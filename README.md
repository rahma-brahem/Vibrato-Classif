# Vibrato-Classif
# Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and classification of vibrational signals to diagnose faults in electrical machines. Utilizing time series data, we aim to develop an effective classification method tailored for vibrational signals obtained from various sensors under different operating conditions.

The project involves several key steps: exploring the dataset to understand the different operating modes and classes, segmenting the signals for better analysis, and converting these time series into visual formats. We will then employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the encoded images of the signals, ultimately evaluating the model's performance and accuracy in diagnosing machine faults.
